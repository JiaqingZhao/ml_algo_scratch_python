# MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FROM SCRATCH
## Jiaqing Zhao

This repo is for pure learning purposes. The codes are NOT copied and pasted from aother source. Parts of the code may be similar to examples out there but I try to modify the ones I see and change them to my likings. Especially while most "from scratch" codes out there aren't modular, I am training myself to write modular codes. 

For each folder you can find a notebook demostrating my algorithms.

Update: 3/27/19 Random Forest/Decision tree. Next update will be on GBM
