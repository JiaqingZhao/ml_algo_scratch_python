# MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FROM SCRATCH
## Jiaqing Zhao

This repo is for pure learning purposes. The codes are NOT copied and pasted from other source. The structures may be similar but I tried to modify the ones I see and change them to my likings. For each folder you can find a notebook demostrating my algorithms.

Update: 3/27/19 Random Forest/Decision tree. Next update will be on GBM
